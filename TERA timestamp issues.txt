 DANGER : Missing or Data Lost in Transit


 Let's say user have entered Jan 22nd to feb 12th on the UI, then,

 then the query will be fired between these date inclusive of 

 both dates starting from 00:00 hours to ending 23:00 Hours

 with given a result set in UTC.




 If using a range of local timestamps, provided by a user, 

 to query a table containing UTC timestamps, ignoring the different timezones. 

 Need to convert local timestamps to UTC first and

 use the converted value to query the database.

 If you don't things go wrong.




 E.g. say the table contains a record with 

 the timestamp Jan 22nd 23:00 (UTC). 

 When you query the table using the

 local timestamp Jan 23nd 00:00 (UTC+1),

 you are not going to get that record out

 even though they're exactly the same.


 Sample case, the Asia/Kolkata timezone is

 equal to UTC+5:30. So if the database is 

 queried for the UTC timestamp 

 Jan 1st 00:00 and afterwards the result is

 converted to a local datetime,

 the result Jan 1st 00:00 becomes Jan 1st 05:30.
